              Hip-hop dance is a vibrant form of dance that combines a variety of
              freestyle movements to create a cultural piece of art. Through its
              three main styles of popping, locking, and breaking, hip-hop dance has
              evolved into one of the most popular and influential styles of dance.

              It has a more laid-back style that allows dancers to let loose and worry
              less about technique and more about expressing themselves through their
              movement and their music. With more upbeat music, hip-hop dance creates
              a different level of fun and creativity.

            Hip-hop dance began during the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, originally inspired by the movements
            of African dancing, and flourished as a new style of dance performed on
            the street for the people. Hip-hop incorporates aspects of modern dance,
            tap, and swing, integrating music and complex movements to form artistry.
            The early history and roots of hip-hop dance are most often associated
            with its beginning on the East Coast, specifically New York City. But
            the West Coast also formed its own style of the East Coast hip-hop dance
            around the same time. East Coast hip-hop began with the unique rhythmic
            combinations created by Kool DJ Herc, a Jamaican DJ who moved to Brooklyn
            at the age of 12 and quickly became one of the most popular DJ’s of New York
            City. DJ Herc ingeniously thought to extend dance sections of songs to
            create better opportunities to showcase the breaking movements of dancers.
            West Coast hip-hop took the dance style from the East Coast and made it
            its own, transforming some of the frozen moves and making them more robotic.
            The West Coast was also where two of modern hip-hop’s most iconic styles,
            popping and locking, were born.
