              Flamenco dance (baile) is a highly-expressive, Spanish dance form.
              The flamenco is a solo dance characterized by hand clapping,
              percussive footwork, and intricate hand, arm, and body movements.
              The dance is usually accompanied by a singer and guitar player.

            <p>
              Flamenco dance and the guitar music that accompanies it comes from
              southern Spain in the Andalusian region associated with the Roma
              or gypsy people. In Spain, the Roma are called Gitanos. Thought
              to have migrated from northwest India between the 9th and 14th
              centuries, Gitanos used tambourines, bells, and wooden castanets 
              and incorporated it into the music. Flamenco is the result of Roma
              music mixed with the rich cultures of the Sephardic Jews and the
              Moors, also living in southern Spain. If you look closely at
              flamenco dance movements, you may recognize arm, hand, and foot
              movements that closely resemble those of classical Hindu dance
              from the Indian subcontinent.

            <p>
              Probably the most important thing you will need to start flamenco
              dancing is patience. The art of flamenco dance is often difficult
              to master. Besides learning intricate steps and movements, you
              will also need to learn how to nonverbally communicate with a
              musician or a singer. You will be taught how to properly display
              your innermost emotions and feelings to an audience. However, with
              a good instructor and a bit of patience, even an inexperienced
              dancer can learn.
