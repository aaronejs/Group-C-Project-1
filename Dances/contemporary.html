              Contemporary is an important genre of dance performed in societies
              around the world, celebrated by people both young and old.
              Developed during the 20th century, contemporary dance involves
              incorporating aspects of movement from several other genres such
              as jazz, modern and ballet. While contemporary is a popular type
              of dance worldwide, it is most common amongst the U.S and European
              countries.

              Unlike traditional forms of dance, contemporary is considered to
              be somewhat unbound by much rigidity and rules. The dancers of this
              genre have the ability to transform a performance based on their
              own interpretations. This is achieved through honing in on certain
              techniques, such as focusing on strong ballet-influenced leg
              movements, fall and recovery, floor work and further improvisational
              elements. More frequently than not, contemporary dance is performed
              barefoot to allow for more fluidity in movement and connection to
              the dance surface.

              One of the most important aspects of contemporary dance is the
              element of improvisation. While some forms of dance such as ballet
              can be quite rigid and structured, contemporary dance relies on
              fluidity and improvisational movement to evoke a range of feelings
              in the viewer. It also offers the dancer ultimate creative freedom
              to perform an emotive piece that identifies with them.

              Modern-day contemporary dance is incredibly interpretive and has
              many applications. While traditional dance performances are still
              popular, contemporary dance has often been used in art, theatre,
              music videos, movies and more. The versatility of the genre allows
              the dancer to use the influence of a storyline and music to form
              characters and entire theatrical performances that stray away from
              the more traditional methods of storytelling.
